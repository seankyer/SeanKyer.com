A terminal style website forked from m4tt7s (https://term.m4tt72.com)

I like using Linux and I wanted my website to not be so basic. So I forked from a good template and a suite of my own commands so the viewer can learn more about me.

## Quick Start

### Using npm/yarn

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
yarn build
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Deploying

### yarn export

Run `yarn export` to generate the static site. Copy the files from `out/` to your webhost.
